# Competitive Programming Sheet

This Competitive Programming (CP) sheet is curated by **You Know Who Academy** to help programmers master essential topics and improve problem-solving skills.

## üìå About the Sheet
This CP sheet covers a variety of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques that are crucial for competitive programming contests such as **Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, LeetCode, and more**.

## üìö Topics Covered
The sheet is structured into different sections to help you systematically improve your skills:

1. **Basic Implementation & Math**
   - Number Theory (GCD, LCM, Prime Factorization)
   - Bit Manipulation
   - Modular Arithmetic

2. **Data Structures**
   - Arrays & Strings
   - Stack, Queue, Deque
   - Hashing & Maps
   - Trees (BST, Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree)
   - Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall)

3. **Algorithms**
   - Sorting & Searching (Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
   - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LIS, LCS)
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, MST)
   - String Algorithms (KMP, Z-algorithm, Suffix Arrays)

4. **Advanced Topics**
   - Game Theory
   - Computational Geometry
   - Network Flow (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp)
   - Number Theoretic Transforms

## üöÄ How to Use the Sheet
- Start with **basic** topics and solve problems from platforms like Codeforces and AtCoder.
- Move to **data structures and algorithms** and practice common problem patterns.
- Use **editorials & tutorials** when stuck, but always try multiple approaches before checking solutions.
- Participate in **contests regularly** to build speed and accuracy.
